**Activity: (Async) Deployment Certifications**
Most of the areas of full-stack development don't require any sort of certification. Simply having a portfolio of samples and passing a technical interview tends to be enough. Some full-stack positions don't even include any DevOps work. However, when positions do start requiring more DevOps work, certifications become commonplace. Other areas of tech also include certifications such as Cybersecurity, Project Management, and areas of Data Science.

DevOps certifications are popular due to the complexity of the platforms. Getting a certificate in one or more platforms informs the employer or client that you are well acquainted with the technology. Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud make up the majority of the market share. All three have their own certifications.

**Market Share**
There's no requirement that you sign up for a certification for this activity, but you are going to explore the three most popular and what is needed, should you choose to go down this path.

**Part 1) AWS Certification**
AWS makes up the largest share of the market, with nearly 1/3rd of cloud market share. Because of this, AWS certifications are one of the most highly sought in corporate positions. AWS offers a path of certification specifically for developers.

![AWS offers specific developer certification path](https://s3.amazonaws.com/soy-sauce-chris/img/aws_developer_certification_path.png)

As you have noticed, much of this course has been about AWS tools. The goal has been to expose you to the foundational concepts you'll find in all three first-level certifications as well as the AWS specific knowledge needed for the AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification.

The AWS Cloud Practitioner Certification is the first step on the Developer path, containing general cloud terminology as well as AWS specific information. It's good to note the expected familiarity. Many certificates give you a timeframe. Cloud practitioner suggests six months exposure in any capacity. That doesn't mean full-time exposure. It is expected that if you're working with AWS on a project, you'll likely hit all the areas of concern over six months. Many take certifications sooner after dedicated study time.

Spend some time reviewing the Cloud Practitioner page and complete the following:

- What is the length of the exam time and number of questions?
- What is the cost of the practice exam and complete exam?
- Find, download, and review the exam guide.
- Find, download, and review the sample questions. It's likely you won't know the answer to all of the questions, since many of them were not covered yet, but do your best to answer them. There is an answer guide at the bottom.

There are also tons of personal experiences available from individuals who have taken the Cloud Practitioner exam. If you are interested in this path, try watching one or two. You'll see everything from studying for three days to three weeks. [Here is one individual's experience with the exam](https://cloudacademy.com/cloud-computing/what-to-expect-aws-certified-cloud-practitioner-exam-1142/).

If the AWS track interests you, have a look at the Certified Developer Associate certification. Review the exam content outline. You'll see that several of the topics have already been covered in the few hours you've spent working with AWS.

Completing the AWS Developer Certification track is absolutely possible and a great addition to your resume if you plan to include DevOps in your stack.

**Part 2) Microsoft Certification**
The Microsoft Azure Fundamentals Certification (Exam AZ-900) is quite similar to the AWS Cloud Practitioner exam. However, AWS has more general cloud questions than the Azure test. The Azure test is similar in length with 40 to 60 questions and 85 minutes to complete the exam. In total, Microsoft offers 27 Azure certifications. There are four beginner offerings, including the fundamentals certification. After completing the fundamentals certification, the next likely certification is Azure Developer Associate. The following are the relevant certifications for full-stack web development.

![Microsoft Azure offers 5 relevant courses including Azure Fundamentals, Azure Data Fundamentals, Power Platform Solution Architect Expert, Azure Developer, and App Builder](https://s3.amazonaws.com/soy-sauce-chris/img/azure_certification_path.png)

Spend some time reviewing the Cloud Practitioner page and complete the following:

- Find the exam skills outline and review.
- View at least one of the modules available in the learning path.
- Find the link to the official practice test to review what's available to you.

Microsoft offers a great structured learning path to prepare for the fundamental certifications. There are also many free or paid courses available online, including one through Coursera, with approximately 35 hours of content. If you're interested in obtaining a cloud certificate but want a structured environment to do so, the Azure Fundamentals Certification may be the way to go. [Here is one developer's experience with the exam](https://danielchronicle.com/2020/06/03/azure-fundamentals-az-900-exam/).

**Part 3) Google Cloud Certification**
Google Cloud Certifications are becoming increasingly popular due to Google Cloud's continued growth in the cloud market share. Google Cloud offers a specific Cloud Developer certification at their professional level. Both Foundational and Associate certifications are generalized to all developer positions.

![Google cloud certs offered at 3 levels, foundational, associate, and professional](https://s3.amazonaws.com/soy-sauce-chris/img/gcp_certification_path.png)

Spend some time reviewing the Cloud Digital Leader page and complete the following:

- What is the length of the exam time, and question amount?
- What is the cost of the practice exam and complete exam?
- Find, download, and review the exam guide.
- Find and review the sample questions. The questions are done as a Google form. You won't get everything correct, but you will notice the questions are very general and many answers can be inferred from the question.

The Google Cloud Leader exam is very Google Cloud-centric, but it is also one of the easiest to pass, requiring the least experience. Google offers a learning path for preparation that includes 70 minutes of video, three quizzes, and several documents. It won't take much time to complete the training and, if you're looking for a quick certification, the Cloud Digital Leader is the fastest certificate to obtain.

The Associate Cloud Engineer certification is definitely a worthwhile goal. It is comparable to the other platform associate certificates. The recommendation is six months of experience with Google Cloud but it can be done faster. Google does offer learning paths for preparation, but they are not as specified as the Cloud Digital Leader trainings. Expect to review the exam content guide and choose paths related to the specific areas.

**Bonus**
Begin the registration process for one of the certifications. They all offer further guidance on what is expected from the process as well as dos and don'ts for the certificates. There is no need to complete the sign-up, but it is useful to know what's expected before you choose a path.
